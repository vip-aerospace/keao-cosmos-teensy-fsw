<div class="textblock"><p>Although the Teensy is a powerful microcontroller, it does have limitations. In particular, it only has a single CPU to execute instructions. Despite this, we want the Teensy (and Artemis) to do multiple things at the same time (known as multitasking).</p>
<p>To accomplish this, we use a technique known as multithreading. In multithreading, a program (such as the FSW) creates multiple smaller programs (called "threads") that are switched between in order to execute different parts of a program nearly simultaneously.</p>
<p>The specific implementation that the FSW uses is based on the <a href="https://github.com/ftrias/TeensyThreads">TeensyThreads library</a>. In the FSW, we call threads "channels", and we switch between these channels as the program proceeds. The main channel is the channel that is started when the Teensy is powered on. It creates a channel for each functional part of Artemis, and switches between these channels (and itself) based on the computing time assigned to each channel.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="Mutexes"></a>
Mutual Exclusions (Mutexes)</h2>
<p>Each channel is defined in its own file, and essentially behaves as its own independent Arduino sketch. In theory, this is all that is needed to implement multitasking. However, it is not this simple. Just because the channel is the currently active one, does not mean that it has exclusive access to all of the Teensy's hardware.</p>
<p>Consider this example. Channel A uses the Teensy's I2C connection to communicate with a serial device (say, a radio). I2C is a bus-based system, where all devices are connected to the same data bus, and it is up to the Teensy to specify which device on the bus it wishes to communicate with. Now Channel A initiates a connection to the radio, indicating that it will send data to the radio to transmit. However, Channel A's computing time runs out before it can actually send the data that it wants to transmit.</p>
<p>Channel B is up next, and it polls a temperature sensor over the same I2C connection. The Teensy keeps the I2C connection active and sends a request addressed to the sensor. However, the radio interprets the data in its entirety to be the data to transmit, and incorrectly transmits the request. In reality, there are other safeguards against this, but this illustrates the problem.</p>
<p>This type of error is due to collisions in shared resources. These resources could be pins on the Teensy, serial connections, shared memory, etc. To avoid these collisions, we use mutual exclusions (mutexes).</p>
<p>A mutex is essentially a token that ensures that a given channel (thread) is the only one that has access to a resource. It is "locked" when a channel claims access to a resource, and is "unlocked" when the channel is done using the resource. Importantly, if one channel has a mutex locked, it will retain exclusive access to that resource even if that channel is not being actively executed. Thus, if another channel wants to lock that mutex, it will either fail outright or wait until the mutex is no longer locked (depending on the specific implementation).</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="MultithreadingAnalogy"></a>
An Analogy</h2>
<p>To illustrate this, consider this analogy. You have multiple homework assignments for different classes (say Calculus, Circuits, Physics and English). You procrastinated, so they're all due at the same time and there's no time to complete all of them. You could do each individually and in sequence. That is, you complete all Calculus problems, then Circuits, etc. This would allow you to complete all of the Calculus, Circuits, and Physics problems, but you wouldn't have any time to even start the English paper.</p>
<p>You decide to implement a multitasking approach based on multithreading. You set an alarm to go off every 20 minutes, and work on one assignment at a time in that interval. If the alarm goes off, you switch to the next assignment, even if you are in the middle of a problem.</p>
<p>This approach works well and you get a little bit of each assignment done. However, you're working on a Calculus problem, using your calculator, when the alarm goes off! The next assignment is a Circuits program that also requires a calculator. You can't reset or clear the calculator (it has the values you were working on for Calculus), so you skip to the next Circuits problem, noting that you should return to the previous problem when you have access to the calculator again.</p>
<p>You skip forward to Physics. It's a short assignment, so you complete it quickly. You can take the rest of the time you allocated to Physics and idle (do nothing). You then do some of the English paper, then return to Calculus. You complete the problem and release the calculator. You then switch to Physics, now able to use the calculator now that it is free for your use.</p>
<p>This gives a simplified view of what the Teensy's processor is doing when using multithreading. As you can see, computers are much better at multitasking than humans. Even so, just as a human requires time to "get up
to speed" on each transition from one task to another, a computer has a performance penalty for switching between threads. This performance hit is negligible for our purposes, but it does exist. For those interested in computer architecture, the processor must flush and refill its cache when switching between threads. </p>
